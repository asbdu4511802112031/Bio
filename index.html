<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
Hi! I am Vaidheki, I live in a beautiful village named Panchanathikulam. 
I am the second born child in my family. Now, I am 19, almost at the end of my teen years. 
My family is a normal middle-class family with some happiness and many fights. 
My only happiness and torture in my home is my sister's son Kavin. 
He is the little prince of our family. My whole family is living for that prince only. 
His face always brings happiness to us.

<h3>Studies</h3>
<p>
My school studies went well in the Victory Higher Secondary School. 
But my 10th standard life was spoiled, because coronavirus spread all over the world. 
My college life isn't what I expected, but it's good. 
My friends are my healers. I am happy only with these doli's. 
They change my mood within a second.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>
I really like reading books. But, I spend my time watching series and fictional movies. 
I like to listen to music. Music is my therapist. 
Recently, I watched Harry Potter movies. It's my all-time favorite. 
I never get bored of watching this series.
